# brazilian-ecommerce-olist
 This repository contains my exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling on the Brazilian E-commerce Public Dataset provided by Olist. The dataset offers a wide-ranging view of Brazilian e-commerce through multiple linked tables, capturing customer, product, order, payment, and review information across multiple marketplaces from 2016 to 2018.  The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and trends from the data and to build predictive models to help optimize e-commerce strategies. The analyses will cover various aspects of the e-commerce process including customer behavior, product trends, order patterns, payment preferences, and customer reviews, among others.  This project aims to contribute to the understanding of e-commerce dynamics in Brazil and assist in data-driven decision making for e-commerce businesses.
